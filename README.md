# nix-home
Configuration for my unix and linux home directories; dot files, bin files, etc.

> _**NOTE:** This repo's name is changing to `nix-home`, and thus its URL will
change. Theoretically only I use this so..._

## Install
Docs to come. This repo will rely on the handy method seen at
[https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).

# TODO
* I think the git submodules are mis-configured. Look into that.

* Some of the files in this repo should be moved to their own repo and brought
  in via git submodules.

* Move standard dot files into a `dotfiles` directory to separate them from
  things like the `.gitmodules` file which should not be copied like the rest.
