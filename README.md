nix-common
==========

My common tools for &#42;nix machines. This includes utilities and dot files
amongst whatever else...

# Install
... docs soon.

# TODO
* Some of the files in this repo should be moved to their own repo and brought
  in via git submodules.

* Create installation script for anything that needs to be downloaded.
  git-prompt.sh may be a candidate although for now it seems to be getting
  copied from here (not sure how well that'll work between version but works
  for now.

* Honestly, this whole repo could use some work. It was originally forked from
  a co-worker, I made some adjustments, and over time those adjustments have
  gotten ugly.
