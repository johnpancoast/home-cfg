## Install
Docs to come. This repo will rely on the handy method seen at

# TODO
* I think the git submodules are mis-configured. Look into that.

* Some of the files in this repo should be moved to their own repo and brought
  in via git submodules.

* Move standard dot files into a `dotfiles` directory to separate them from
  things like the `.gitmodules` file which should not be copied like the rest.
