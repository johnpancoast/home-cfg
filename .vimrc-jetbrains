" John's vimrc for Jetbrain's IDEs
"
" This file is included via .vimrc.
"
" This confguration is specific for Jetbrains IDEs. Note that Jetbrain's loads
" VIM configuration via the ~/.ideavimrc file which, at the moment, is just
" symlinked to ~/.vimrc which in turn will include this file and others.


" Mappings to allow for `gq` functionality within Jetbrain's IDEs
"
" NOTE:
" Requires the below "Wrap To Column" plugin be installed in Jetbrains.
" https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7234-wrap-to-column
"
" TODO also add Wrap to Paragraph (dunno difference ATM).
